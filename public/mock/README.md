# Mock Images Directory

This directory contains placeholder images for development. In production, these would be replaced with actual uploaded images.

## Directory Structure

- `/hero/` - Hero section background images
- `/products/` - Product photos  
- `/team/` - Team member photos
- `/testimonials/` - Customer avatars
- `/templates/` - Template previews

## Placeholder URLs

For development, we use placeholder image services:

- Product images: `https://picsum.photos/400/300?random=1`
- Team photos: `https://picsum.photos/300/300?random=2` 
- Hero images: `https://picsum.photos/1200/600?random=3`
- Avatars: `https://picsum.photos/100/100?random=4`

Replace these with actual asset URLs in production.
